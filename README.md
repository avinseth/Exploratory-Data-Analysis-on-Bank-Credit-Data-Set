This is the datset on Bank Credit information, that is thsi data has information of various people who have taken laon from the bank. The dat set coversthe basic information about every customer, like their demographics and also detailed information on the amount borrowed from bank or a financial institition. 
So what we have workded out on this dataset is the following:
- Is there a growth in defaulters in the current data as comapred to the previous years data
- Which gender of people are more likely to default on a loan
- Profession wise analysis of defaulters and non defaulters
- Analysis of defaulters and non defaulters based on their salary bracket
- Recomendations for bank/financial bodies on which factors they need to work on while offering loan to the customers

This Assignment basically aims as identifying the various factors in BFSI that lead to default paymnets in loans, so that at the time of lending money to a customers the bank or the financial institution does not face any money loss. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
